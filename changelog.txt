Dec 18th 2006 - version 1.1

1. Fixed some padding issues and list style type issues in the comment section.
2. Fixed theme url in stylesheet and footer
3. Changed h3 headers in posts

Dec 19th 2006 - version 1.2

1. Fixed all the meta links, they were pointing to my site, also changed everything to rss2 feeds
2. Changed all <?php bloginfo('siteurl'); ?> to <?php echo get_settings('home'); ?>/ as some websites were sending out 404s
3. Updated the 404 page
4. Added a date stamp into the archive page
5. Added in (but commented out) a by author line in archive.php, index.php, single.php, and search.php
6. Increased the left padding on unordered lists and gave it a 3x3 gray bullet, also increased the padding on ordered lists because when you had more than 10 bullets half the number got cutout.

Dec 19th 2006 - version 1.3

1. Added overflow: auto; to the commentlist li tag and the .entry tag, this way if you have a really long string of letters without any spaces in between them, no horizontal scrollbars are created.
2. Added some more content in the FAQ section (where the theme options should be).

Dec 20th 2006 - version 1.4

1. Changed screenshot size from 300x225 pixels to 300x250 pixels
2. Commented out the author section in archive.php, index.php, single.php, and search.php using php comments instead of html comments. This way wordpress doesn't actually call the function.
3. Updated the FAQ (where the theme options should be) to reflect change #2
4. Took out overflow: auto, and height: 1% away from the .main tag, because when the size of the page is massively large (ie) the wordpress themes post which has 850+ comments) everything breaks in all browsers. 
5. Took out the border-bottom on individual comments and replaced it with a repeating dot image of the colour. This is because at varying font sizes the border would disappear unless it was at least 2px thick, so I replaced it with something more consistent.
6. Changed the login / logout part in the sidebar to be dynamic, before it only listed logout regardless of whether you were actually logged in or not.

January 10th 2006

1. Fixed a couple spelling mistakes all over the place
2. Added better documentation of any css hacks used in the stylesheet
3. Added horizontal lines to separate sections of the page, they only appear when the stylesheet has been disabled
4. Added some more information in the FAQ (where the theme options should be)
