				<ol>
					<li>The page may have been renamed or moved recently</li>
					<li>If you were redirected here from another page, their link may be outdated</li>
					<li>You may have typed in the url into the address bar incorrectly</li>

				<p>Don't worry though you can still use the navigation links to get to some pretty interesting stuff. If it's something particular you're missing, or just want to let us know, email <a href="mailto:hello@petenawara.com">hello@petenawara.com</a>.</p>
